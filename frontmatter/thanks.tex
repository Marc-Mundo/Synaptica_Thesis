\noindent I am immensely grateful to Marijn Martens and Sean Gies for their guidance and mentorship
during my six-month internship at Synaptica B.V. Their expertise and support were instrumental
in shaping both the practical and theoretical aspects of my work as a neurobiology Master's student.

Marijn Martens provided invaluable insights that enhanced
my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills, which were crucial
in the completion of this thesis. Also the availability to work
at the office of Synaptica B.V. with access to great computational resources was a great help,
in addition to providing the means to travel to the office.

Sean Gies offered thorough and patient  explanations of complex technical processes,
significantly deepening my understanding of programming. Both Marijn and Sean were always
available to answer my questions and provide feedback, and allowed for
a collaborative and supportive environment that fostered my growth as a researcher.

I also want to thank the entire team and other students at Synaptica B.V. for their support and encouragement throughout my internship.w
Their feedback and suggestions were instrumental in shaping the direction of my research.

This thesis undoubtedly benefitted from their profound professional guidance, and for that, I am truly thankful.
I am also appreciative of the opportunity to have worked under their tutelage, which has enriched my growth and
development in unimaginable ways.
