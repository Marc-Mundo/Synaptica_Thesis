\section*{Acknowledgements}
I am immensely grateful to Marijn Martens and Sean Gies for their guidance and
mentorship during my six-month internship at Synaptica B.V. Their expertise
was crucial in both practical and theoretical aspects of my work as a
Master's student.
Marijn Martens provided invaluable insights that enhanced my analytical thinking
and problem-solving skills, vital for completing this thesis. The opportunity to
work at Synaptica B.V., with access to excellent computational resources and
travel support, greatly contributed to my experience.
Observing the company's growth and the scale of projects managed by Sean,
Arthogrul, and their teams was particularly inspiring. It was motivating to see
the progress made over my tenure, adding a valuable perspective to my career
path.
Special thanks to Sean Gies for his thorough and patient explanations of complex
technical processes, which deepened my understanding of programming significantly.
Both Marijn and Sean were always approachable, providing feedback and fostering
a collaborative environment that supported my development as a researcher.
I am also thankful to the entire team and fellow students at Synaptica B.V. for
their support and encouragement throughout my internship. Their feedback
and suggestions played a significant role in shaping my research direction.
This thesis has undoubtedly benefited from their profound professional guidance,
and for that, I am truly thankful.
