  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Genetic epilepsy occurs as a result of mutations in either a single gene or an interplay of different genes. These mutations have been detected in ion channel and non-ion channel genes. A noteworthy class of ion channel genes are the voltage gated sodium channels (VGSCs) that play key roles in the depolarization phase of action potentials in neurons. Of huge significance are {$<$}italic{$>$}SCN1A, SCN1B, SCN2A, SCN3A{$<$}/italic{$>$}, and {$<$}italic{$>$}SCN8A{$<$}/italic{$>$} genes that are highly expressed in the brain. Genomic studies have revealed inherited and {$<$}italic{$>$}de novo{$<$}/italic{$>$} mutations in sodium channels that are linked to different forms of epilepsies. Due to the high frequency of sodium channel mutations in epilepsy, this review discusses the pathogenic mutations in the sodium channel genes that lead to epilepsy. In addition, it explores the functional studies on some known mutations and the clinical significance of VGSC mutations in the medical management of epilepsy. The understanding of these channel mutations may serve as a strong guide in making effective treatment decisions in patient management.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Although the pathophysiological mechanisms underpinning these impairments remain elusive, it is thought that WM depends on oscillatory interactions within and between nodes of large-scale functional networks. These include the hippocampus and default mode network as well as the prefrontal cortex and frontoparietal central executive network. Here, we review the functional roles of neural oscillations in subserving WM and the putative mechanisms by which epilepsy disrupts normative activity, leading to aberrant oscillatory signatures. We highlight the particular role of interictal epileptic activity, including interictal epileptiform discharges and high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in WM deficits. We also discuss the translational opportunities presented by greater understanding of the oscillatory basis of WM function and dysfunction in epilepsy, including the potential targets for neuromodulation.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy is a chronic disease of the brain characterized by an enduring (i.e., persisting) predisposition to generate seizures, unprovoked by any immediate central nervous system insult, and by the neurobiologic, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of seizure recurrences. Epilepsy affects both sexes and all ages with worldwide distribution. The prevalence and the incidence of epilepsy are slightly higher in men compared to women and tend to peak in the elderly, reflecting the higher frequency of stroke, neurodegenerative diseases, and tumors in this age-group. Focal seizures are more common than generalized seizures both in children and in adults. The etiology of epilepsy varies according to the sociodemographic characteristics of the affected populations and the extent of the diagnostic workup, but a documented cause is still lacking in about 50\% of cases from high-income countries (HIC). The overall prognosis of epilepsy is favorable in the majority of patients when measured by seizure freedom. Reports from low/middle-income countries (LMIC; where patients with epilepsy are largely untreated) give prevalence and remission rates that overlap those of HICs. As the incidence of epilepsy appears higher in most LMICs, the overlapping prevalence can be explained by misdiagnosis, acute symptomatic seizures and premature mortality. Studies have consistently shown that about one-half of cases tend to achieve prolonged seizure remission. However, more recent reports on the long-term prognosis of epilepsy have identified differing prognostic patterns, including early and late remission, a relapsing-remitting course, and even a worsening course (characterized by remission followed by relapse and unremitting seizures). Epilepsy per se carries a low mortality risk, but significant differences in mortality rates are expected when comparing incidence and prevalence studies, children and adults, and persons with idiopathic and symptomatic seizures. Sudden unexplained death is most frequent in people with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, nocturnal seizures, and drug refractory epilepsy.},

Here we report a form of channelopathy that is acquired in experimental temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the most common form of epilepsy in adults. The excitability of CA1 pyramidal neuron dendrites was increased in TLE because of decreased availability of A-type potassium ion channels due to transcriptional (loss of channels) and posttranslational (increased channel phosphorylation by extracellular signal-regulated kinase) mechanisms. Kinase inhibition partly reversed dendritic excitability to control levels. Such acquired channelopathy is likely to amplify neuronal activity and may contribute to the initiation and/or propagation of seizures in TLE.},

  abstract = {The mammalian forebrain is constructed from ensembles of neurons that form local microcircuits giving rise to the exquisite cognitive tasks the mammalian brain can perform. Hippocampal neuronal circuits comprise populations of relatively homogenous excitatory neurons, principal cells and exceedingly heterogeneous inhibitory neurons, the interneurons. Interneurons release GABA from their axon terminals and are capable of controlling excitability in every cellular compartment of principal cells and interneurons alike; thus, they provide a brake on excess activity, control the timing of neuronal discharge and provide modulation of synaptic transmission. The dendritic and axonal morphology of interneurons, as well as their afferent and efferent connections within hippocampal circuits, is central to their ability to differentially control excitability, in a cell-type- and compartment-specific manner. This review aims to provide an up-to-date compendium of described hippocampal interneuron subtypes, with respect to their morphology, connectivity, neurochemistry and physiology, a full understanding of which will in time help to explain the rich diversity of neuronal function.},

  abstract = {Genetic variants in brain-expressed voltage-gated sodium channels (SCNs) have emerged as one of the most frequent causes of Mendelian forms of epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). This review explores the biological concepts that underlie sodium channel NDDs, explains their phenotypic heterogeneity, and appraises how this knowledge may inform clinical practice. We observe that excitatory/inhibitory neuronal expression ratios of sodium channels are important regulatory mechanisms underlying brain development, homeostasis, and neurological diseases. We hypothesize that a detailed understanding of gene expression, variant tolerance, location, and function, as well as timing of seizure onset can aid the understanding of how variants in SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN3A, and SCN8A contribute to seizure aetiology and inform treatment choice. We propose a model in which variant type, development-specific gene expression, and functions of SCNs explain the heterogeneity of sodium channel associated NDDs. Understanding of basic disease mechanisms and detailed knowledge of variant characteristics have increasing influence on clinical decision making, enabling us to stratify treatment and move closer towards precision medicine in sodium channel epilepsy and NDDs. What this paper adds Sodium-channel disorder heterogeneity is explained by variant-specific gene expression timing and function. Gene tolerance and location analyses aid sodium channel variant interpretation. Sodium-channel variant characteristics can contribute to clinical decision making.},

Pharmacological inhibition of hyperactive KNa1.1 channels by quinidine has been proposed as a stratified treatment, but mostly this has not been successful, being linked to the low potency and lack of specificity of the drug. Here we describe the use of a previously determined cryo-electron microscopy-derived KNa1.1 structure and mutational analysis to identify how quinidine binds to the channel pore and, using computational methods, screened for compounds predicated to bind to this site. We describe six compounds that inhibited KNa1.1 channels with low- and sub-micromolar potencies, likely also through binding in the intracellular pore vestibule. In hERG inhibition and cytotoxicity assays, two compounds were ineffective. These may provide starting points for the development of new pharmacophores and could become tool compounds to study this channel further.},

Accurate detection of periods of bursting activity is thus an important aspect of characterising both spontaneous and evoked neuronal network activity.

We reveal limitations in a number of commonly used burst detection techniques and provide recommendations for the best practice for accurate identification of bursts using existing techniques. An analysis of the ontogeny of bursting activity in a novel data set of recordings from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuronal networks, using the highest-performing burst detectors from our study, is also presented., Accurate identification of bursting activity is an essential element in the characterization of neuronal network activity. Despite this, no one technique for identifying bursts in spike trains has been widely adopted. Instead, many methods have been developed for the analysis of bursting activity, often on an ad hoc basis. Here we provide an unbiased assessment of the effectiveness of eight of these methods at detecting bursts in a range of spike trains. We suggest a list of features that an ideal burst detection technique should possess and use synthetic data to assess each method in regard to these properties. We further employ each of the methods to reanalyze microelectrode array (MEA) recordings from mouse retinal ganglion cells and examine their coherence with bursts detected by a human observer. We show that several common burst detection techniques perform poorly at analyzing spike trains with a variety of properties. We identify four promising burst detection techniques, which are then applied to MEA recordings of networks of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons and used to describe the ontogeny of bursting activity in these networks over several months of development. We conclude that no current method can provide “perfect” burst detection results across a range of spike trains; however, two burst detection techniques, the MaxInterval and logISI methods, outperform compared with others. We provide recommendations for the robust analysis of bursting activity in experimental recordings using current techniques.},

In this first paper, we construct a mathematical model consisting of a single conductance-based neuron together with intra- and extracellular ion concentration dynamics. We formulate a reduction of this model that permits a detailed bifurcation analysis, and show that the reduced model is a reasonable approximation of the full model. We find that competition between intrinsic neuronal currents, sodium-potassium pumps, glia, and diffusion can produce very slow and large-amplitude oscillations in ion concentrations similar to what is seen physiologically in seizures. Using the reduced model, we identify the dynamical mechanisms that give rise to these phenomena. These models reveal several experimentally testable predictions. Our work emphasizes the critical role of ion concentration homeostasis in the proper functioning of neurons, and points to important fundamental processes that may underlie pathological states such as epilepsy.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy is a paroxysmal brain disorder that results from an imbalance between neuronal excitation and inhi­ bition. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the most important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain and plays an important role in the occurrence and development of epilepsy. Abnormalities in all aspects of GABA metabolism, including GABA synthesis, transport, genes encoding GABA receptors, and GABA inactivation, may lead to epilepsy. GABRA1, GABRA2, GABRA5, GABRB1, GABRB2, GABRB3, GABRG2 and GABBR2 are genes that encode GABA receptors and are commonly associated with epilepsy. Mutations of these genes lead to a variety of epilepsy syndromes with different clinical phenotypes, primarily by down regulating receptor expression and reducing the amplitude of GABA-evoked potentials. GABA is metabolized by GABA transaminase and succinate semi aldehyde dehydrogenase, which are encoded by the ABAT and ALDH5A1 genes, respectively. Mutations of these genes result in symptoms related to deficiency of GABA transaminase and succinate semi aldehyde de­ hydrogenase, such as epilepsy and cognitive impairment. Most of the variation in genes associated with GABA metabolism are accompanied by developmental disorders. This review focuses on advances in understanding the relationship between genetic variation in GABA metabolism and epilepsy to establish a basis for the accurate diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy.},

This definition is usually practically applied as having two unprovoked seizures {$>$}24 h apart. The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) accepted recommendations of a task force altering the practical definition for special circumstances that do not meet the two unprovoked seizures criteria. The task force proposed that epilepsy be considered to be a disease of the brain defined by any of the following conditions: (1) At least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring {$>$}24 h apart; (2) one unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60\%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years; (3) diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome. Epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who either had an age-dependent epilepsy syndrome but are now past the applicable age or who have remained seizure-free for the last 10 years and off antiseizure medicines for at least the last 5 years. “Resolved” is not necessarily identical to the conventional view of “remission or “cure.” Different practical definitions may be formed and used for various specific purposes. This revised definition of epilepsy brings the term in concordance with common use. A PowerPoint slide summarizing this article is available for download in the Supporting Information section here.},

  abstract = {With the development and application of next-generation sequencing technology, the aetiological diagnosis of genetic epilepsy is rapidly becoming easier and less expensive. Additionally, there is a growing body of research into precision therapy based on genetic diagnosis. The numerous genes in the potassium ion channel family constitute the largest family of ion channels: this family is divided into different subtypes. Potassium ion channels play a crucial role in the electrical activity of neurons and are directly involved in the mechanism of epileptic seizures. In China, scientific research on genetic diagnosis and studies of precision therapy for genetic epilepsy are progressing rapidly. Many cases of epilepsy caused by mutation of potassium channel genes have been identified, and several potassium channel gene targets and drug candidates have been discovered. The purpose of this review is to briefly summarize the progress of research on the precise diagnosis and treatment of potassium ion channel-related genetic epilepsy, especially the research conducted in China. Here in, we review several large cohort studies on the genetic diagnosis of epilepsy in China in recent years, summarized the proportion of potassium channel genes. We focus on the progress of precison therapy on some hot epilepsy related potassium channel genes: KCNA1, KCNA2, KCNB1, KCNC1, KCND2, KCNQ2, KCNQ3, KCNMA1, and KCNT1.},

  abstract = {Under certain conditions, regenerative voltage spikes can be initiated locally in the dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons. These are interesting events that could potentially provide neurons with additional computational abilities. Using whole-cell dendritic recordings from the distal apical trunk and proximal tuft regions and realistic computer modeling, we have determined that highly synchronized and moderately clustered inputs are required for dendritic spike initiation: ∼50 synaptic inputs spread over 100 μm of the apical trunk/tuft need to be activated within 3 msec. Dendritic spikes are characterized by a more depolarized voltage threshold than at the soma [-48 ± 1 mV (n = 30) vs -56 ± 1 mV (n = 7), respectively] and are mainly generated and shaped by dendritic Na+ and K+ currents. The relative contribution of AMPA and NMDA currents is also important in determining the actual spatiotemporal requirements for dendritic spike initiation. Once initiated, dendritic spikes can easily reach the soma, but their propagation is only moderately strong, so that it can be modulated by physiologically relevant factors such as changes in the Vm and the ionic composition of the extracellular solution. With effective spike propagation, an extremely short-latency neuronal output is produced for greatly reduced input levels. Therefore, dendritic spikes function as efficient detectors of specific input patterns, ensuring that the neuronal response to high levels of input synchrony is a precisely timed action potential output.},

It is unlikely that there is a singular mechanism that applies to all epilepsy syndromes.This concept classically refers to the acquired epilepsies but can be viewed as applicable to at least some genetically determined epilepsies as well.Specific themes have emerged in recent years that may represent points of convergence in the field of epileptogenesis, including abnormal signalling by large-scale molecular cascades such as mammalian target of rapamycin and repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST), the dysfunction of particular neuronal cell types with seeming importance in basic mechanisms of epilepsy and dysfunction of discrete neuronal circuit elements.Seizures are by definition circuit-level phenomena that require the re-entrant activation of embedded loop structures within cortical circuits. The above-mentioned considerations further highlight circuit-level considerations and analysis in our future understanding of epileptogenesis and mechanisms of epilepsy.},

Recent studies recorded and manipulated the activity of different neuron types in the DG during memory tasks and have provided exciting new insights into the mechanisms of DG computational processes, particularly for the encoding, retrieval and discrimination of similar memories.

AD may be an important cause of epilepsy in the elderly. Early diagnosis of diseases is very important for their successful treatment. Many efforts have been done for defining new biomarkers of these diseases. Significant advances have been made in the searching of some AD and TLE reliable biomarkers, including cerebrospinal fluid and plasma measurements and glucose positron emission tomography. However, there is a great need for the biomarkers that would reflect changes of brain activity within few milliseconds to obtain information about cognitive disturbances. Successful early detection of AD and TLE requires specific biomarkers capable of distinguishing individuals with the progressing disease from ones with other pathologies that affect cognition. In this article, we review recent evidence suggesting that magnetoencephalographic recordings and coherent analysis coupled with behavioral evaluation can be a promising approach to an early detection of AD and TLE., Highlights –Data reviewed include the results of clinical and experimental studies.–Theta and gamma rhythms are disturbed in epilepsy and AD.–Common and different behavioral and oscillatory features of pathologies are compared.–Coherent analysis can be useful for an early diagnostics of diseases.},

  abstract = {Loss of function mutations of SCN1A, the gene coding for the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.1, cause different types of epilepsy, whereas gain of function mutations cause sporadic and familial hemiplegic migraine type 3 (FHM-3). However, it is not clear yet how these opposite effects can induce paroxysmal pathological activities involving neuronal networks’ hyperexcitability that are specific of epilepsy (seizures) or migraine (cortical spreading depolarization, CSD). To better understand differential mechanisms leading to the initiation of these pathological activities, we used a two-neuron conductance-based model of interconnected GABAergic and pyramidal glutamatergic neurons, in which we incorporated ionic concentration dynamics in both neurons. We modeled FHM-3 mutations by increasing the persistent sodium current in the interneuron and epileptogenic mutations by decreasing the sodium conductance in the interneuron. Therefore, we studied both FHM-3 and epileptogenic mutations within the same framework, modifying only two parameters. In our model, the key effect of gain of function FHM-3 mutations is ion fluxes modification at each action potential (in particular the larger activation of voltage-gated potassium channels induced by the NaV1.1 gain of function), and the resulting CSD-triggering extracellular potassium accumulation, which is not caused only by modifications of firing frequency. Loss of function epileptogenic mutations, on the other hand, increase GABAergic neurons’ susceptibility to depolarization block, without major modifications of firing frequency before it. Our modeling results connect qualitatively to experimental data: potassium accumulation in the case of FHM-3 mutations and facilitated depolarization block of the GABAergic neuron in the case of epileptogenic mutations. Both these effects can lead to pyramidal neuron hyperexcitability, inducing in the migraine condition depolarization block of both the GABAergic and the pyramidal neuron. Overall, our findings suggest different mechanisms of network hyperexcitability for migraine and epileptogenic NaV1.1 mutations, implying that the modifications of firing frequency may not be the only relevant pathological mechanism.},

  abstract = {Computer modelling of epilepsy is a branch of systems biology, a science that aims to combine the discoveries made by reductionist approaches into systems in order to understand how primary pathologies and secondary reactions interact to produce disease. Epilepsy, a dynamical disease of the brain, is well suited to study from the perspective of dynamical systems.Epilepsy is a complex set of syndromes with the commonality of recurrent seizures. Not only do the many individual epilepsy syndromes have different causes, but most epilepsies develop owing to the interaction of many causes at molecular, cellular, network and developmental levels, defying efforts to define simple cause-and-effect relations and suggesting the need for computer modelling.Knowledge discovery and data mining provides the substrate and support for dynamical modelling and allows the findings to be applied back to the research and clinical settings. The various dynamical modelling techniques that are used include stochastic models, low-dimensional (lumped) deterministic models and detailed neuronal network models.Computer models are applied across the range of epilepsy phenomenology, from the molecular to the clinical. At the patient level, Markov models have been used to assess patterns of remission and relapse in pediatric epilepsy. At the molecular level, deterministic models can predict alterations in cellular activity with ion-channel mutations.Many seizure models simulate activity at the network level. Some of these are lumped models, which use mean-field approximations to reduce the activity of many neurons to simple oscillators that are then coupled to produce complex activity patterns. Other models incorporate the details of neural activity and synaptic interactions, in order to reach down to the molecular level at which drug effects take place.Uncommonly among areas of neuroscience research, computer modelling is immediately accessible through downloads of established models. An intrinsically collaborative activity, the future of the endeavour lies in the cooperative efforts of clinicians, experimentalists and modellers.},

Decreased Ih activity, as seen in experimental temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), could significantly alter the response of dendrites to theta inputs. Here we report a progressive erosion of theta resonance and phase lead in pyramidal cell dendrites during epileptogenesis in a rat model of TLE. These alterations were due to decreased Ih availability, via a decline in HCN1/HCN2 subunit expression resulting in decreased h currents, and altered kinetics of the residual channels. This acquired HCN channelopathy thus compromises temporal coding and tuning to theta inputs in pyramidal cell dendrites. Decreased theta resonance in vitro also correlated with a reduction in theta frequency and power in vivo. We suggest that the neuronal/circuitry changes associated with TLE, including altered Ih-dependent inductive mechanisms, can disrupt hippocampal theta function.},

  abstract = {Background This systematic review of epilepsy mortality systematic reviews evaluates comparative risks, causes, and risk factors for all-cause mortality in people with epilepsy (PWE) to specifically establish the burden of epilepsy-related deaths. Methods MEDLINE and Embase were searched from conception to 26/12/2018 for systematic reviews evaluating all-cause mortality in PWE of any age. Independent study selection, data extraction and quality assessment were performed. Deaths were separated into epilepsy-related and unrelated using a recently published classification system. Outcomes included standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and mortality rate (MR) in a primary analysis of comparative risks, causes, and risk factors for all-cause and epilepsy-related mortality. A narrative synthesis of review findings was used to present results, including from a secondary analysis of individual epilepsy-related death risk factors. Results Six moderate or high-quality systematic reviews were included in the primary analysis, evaluating 103 observational studies. All-cause mortality remained similarly high between 1950 and present (median SMR range 2.2–3.4). Africa had the highest SMR (median 5.4, range 2.6–7.2). SMRs were also higher for children {$<$}18 years (median 7.5, range 3.1–22.4) than adults (median 2.6, range 1.3–8.7), and for epilepsy-related (median 3.8, range 0.0–82.4,) than unrelated causes (median 1.7, range 0.7–17.6). Structural brain disease conferred the greatest risk for all-cause mortality (SMR range 24.0–41.5). Common epilepsy-related causes included alcohol, drowning, pneumonia, and suicide. In secondary analysis of nine additional systematic reviews, epilepsy-related death risk factors were reported for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), drowning and suicide. Conclusions Premature all-cause mortality remains a major problem in PWE globally, particularly in children and young adults, with most being epilepsy-related and potentially preventable. SUDEP is only one of several other common and important epilepsy-related causes of death.},

Using a realistic model of a hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neuron, we show a major role for the hyperpolarization-activated current, Ih, in regulating the spike probability of a neuron when independent synaptic inputs are activated with different degrees of synchronization and at different distances from the soma. The results allowed us to make the experimentally testable prediction that the Ihin these neurons is needed to reduce neuronal excitability selectively for distal unsynchronized, but not for synchronized, inputs.},

Each processor integrates the equations for its subnet over an interval equal to the minimum (interprocessor) presynaptic spike generation to postsynaptic spike delivery connection delay. The performance of three published network models with very different spike patterns exhibits superlinear speedup on Beowulf clusters and demonstrates that spike communication overhead is often less than the benefit of an increased fraction of the entire problem fitting into high speed cache. On the EPFL IBM Blue Gene, almost linear speedup was obtained up to 100 processors. Increasing one model from 500 to 40,000 realistic cells exhibited almost linear speedup on 2000 processors, with an integration time of 9.8 seconds and communication time of 1.3~seconds. The potential for speed-ups of several orders of magnitude makes practical the running of large network simulations that could otherwise not be explored.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy is a devastating brain disorder for which effective treatments are very limited. There is growing interest in early intervention, which requires a better mechanistic understanding of the early stages of this disorder. While diverse brain insults can lead to epileptic activity, a common cellular mechanism relies on uncontrolled recurrent excitatory activity. In the dentate gyrus, excitatory mossy cells (MCs) project extensively onto granule cells (GCs) throughout the hippocampus, thus establishing a recurrent MC-GC-MC excitatory loop. MCs are implicated in temporal lobe epilepsy, a common form of epilepsy, but their role during initial seizures (i.e., before the characteristic MC loss that occurs in late stages) is unclear. Here, we show that initial seizures acutely induced with an intraperitoneal kainic acid (KA) injection in adult mice, a well-established model that leads to experimental epilepsy, not only increased MC and GC activity in~vivo but also triggered a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)–dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) at MC-GC excitatory synapses. Moreover, in~vivo induction of MC-GC LTP using MC-selective optogenetic stimulation worsened KA-induced seizures. Conversely, Bdnf genetic removal from GCs, which abolishes LTP, and selective MC silencing were both anticonvulsant. Thus, initial seizures are associated with MC-GC synaptic strengthening, which may promote later epileptic activity. Our findings reveal a potential mechanism of epileptogenesis that may help in developing therapeutic strategies for early intervention.},

  abstract = {Abnormalities in oscillations have been suggested to play a role in schizophrenia. We studied theta-modulated gamma oscillations in a computer model of hippocampal CA3 in vivo with and without simulated application of ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist and psychotomimetic. Networks of 1200 multicompartment neurons [pyramidal, basket, and oriens-lacunosum moleculare (OLM) cells] generated theta and gamma oscillations from intrinsic network dynamics: basket cells primarily generated gamma and amplified theta, while OLM cells strongly contributed to theta. Extrinsic medial septal inputs paced theta and amplified both theta and gamma oscillations. Exploration of NMDA receptor reduction across all location combinations demonstrated that the experimentally observed ketamine effect occurred only with isolated reduction of NMDA receptors on OLMs. In the ketamine simulations, lower OLM activity reduced theta power and disinhibited pyramidal cells, resulting in increased basket cell activation and gamma power. Our simulations predict the following: (1) ketamine increases firing rates; (2) oscillations can be generated by intrinsic hippocampal circuits; (3) medial-septum inputs pace and augment oscillations; (4) pyramidal cells lead basket cells at the gamma peak but lag at trough; (5) basket cells amplify theta rhythms; (6) ketamine alters oscillations due to primary blockade at OLM NMDA receptors; (7) ketamine alters phase relationships of cell firing; (8) ketamine reduces network responsivity to the environment; (9) ketamine effect could be reversed by providing a continuous inward current to OLM cells. We suggest that this last prediction has implications for a possible novel treatment for cognitive deficits of schizophrenia by targeting OLM cells.},

At the level of cellular physiology, K+~channels control neuronal intrinsic excitability and are the main contributors to membrane repolarization of active neurons. Recently, a genetically modified voltage-dependent K+ channel has been patented as a remedy for epileptic seizures. We review the role of potassium channels in excitability, clinical and experimental evidence for the association of potassium channelopathies with epilepsy, the targeting of K+~channels by drugs, and perspectives of gene therapy in epilepsy with the expression of extra K+~channels in the brain.

It is proposed here that gamma and theta oscillations allow for the transient interaction between cortical structures and the hippocampus for the encoding and retrieval of episodic memories as described by the hippocampal memory indexing theory (Teyler and DiScenna, 1986). Gamma rhythms can act in the cortex to bind perceptual features and in the hippocampus to bind the rich perceptual and contextual information from diverse brain regions into episodic representations. Theta oscillations act to temporally order these individual episodic memory representations. Through feedback projections from the hippocampus to the cortex these gamma and theta patterns could cause the reinstatement of the entire episodic memory representation in the cortex. In addition, theta oscillations could allow for top-down control from the frontal cortex to the hippocampus modulating the encoding and retrieval of episodic memories.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Epilepsy is well-recognized as a disorder of brain networks. There is a growing body of research to identify critical nodes within dynamic epileptic networks with the aim to target therapies that halt the onset and propagation of seizures. In parallel, intracranial neuromodulation, including deep brain stimulation and responsive neurostimulation, are well-established and expanding as therapies to reduce seizures in adults with focal-onset epilepsy; and there is emerging evidence for their efficacy in children and generalized-onset seizure disorders. The convergence of these advancing fields is driving an era of ‘network-guided neuromodulation’ for epilepsy. In this review, we distil the current literature on network mechanisms underlying neurostimulation for epilepsy. We discuss the modulation of key ‘propagation points’ in the epileptogenic network, focusing primarily on thalamic nuclei targeted in current clinical practice. These include (i) the anterior nucleus of thalamus, now a clinically approved and targeted site for open loop stimulation, and increasingly targeted for responsive neurostimulation; and (ii) the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus, a target for both deep brain stimulation and responsive neurostimulation in generalized-onset epilepsies. We discuss briefly the networks associated with other emerging neuromodulation targets, such as the pulvinar of the thalamus, piriform cortex, septal area, subthalamic nucleus, cerebellum and others. We report synergistic findings garnered from multiple modalities of investigation that have revealed structural and functional networks associated with these propagation points — including scalp and invasive EEG, and diffusion and functional MRI. We also report on intracranial recordings from implanted devices which provide us data on the dynamic networks we are aiming to modulate. Finally, we review the continuing evolution of network-guided neuromodulation for epilepsy to accelerate progress towards two translational goals: (i) to use pre-surgical network analyses to determine patient candidacy for neurostimulation for epilepsy by providing network biomarkers that predict efficacy; and (ii) to deliver precise, personalized and effective antiepileptic stimulation to prevent and arrest seizure propagation through mapping and modulation of each patients’ individual epileptogenic networks.},

The visualization and analysis of hubs offers a perspective on regional and global network organization and can provide novel insights into brain disorders and epilepsy. By notably supporting the interaction between various brain networks, hubs may be implicated in seizure spread and in epilepsy-related phenotypes. In this review, we will discuss the growing literature on atypical hub organization in common epilepsy syndromes, both related to neuroimaging of brain structure and function, and related to neurophysiological data from magneto- and electroencephalographic measures of neural dynamics. With studies increasingly exploring the clinical utility of network neuroscience approaches, we highlight the potential of hub mapping as a candidate biomarker of cognitive dysfunction and postsurgical seizure outcome.

  abstract = {Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a common type of epilepsy with hippocampus as the usual site of origin. The CA3 subfield of hippocampus is reported to have a low epileptic threshold and hence initiates the disorder in patients with TLE. This study computationally investigates how impaired dendritic inhibition of pyramidal cells in the vulnerable CA3 subfield leads to generation of epileptic activity. A model of CA3 subfield consisting of 800 pyramidal cells, 200 basket cells (BC) and 200 Oriens—Lacunosum Moleculare (O-LM) interneurons was used. The dendritic inhibition provided by O-LM interneurons is reported to be selectively impaired in some TLEs. A step-wise approach is taken to investigate how alterations in network connectivity lead to generation of epileptic patterns. Initially, dendritic inhibition alone was reduced, followed by an increase in the external inputs received at the distal dendrites of pyramidal cells, and finally additional changes were made at the synapses between all neurons in the network. In the first case, when the dendritic inhibition of pyramidal cells alone was reduced, the local field potential activity changed from a theta-modulated gamma pattern to a prominently gamma frequency pattern. In the second case, in addition to this reduction of dendritic inhibition, with a simultaneous large increase in the external excitatory inputs received by pyramidal cells, the basket cells entered a state of depolarization block, causing the network to generate a typical ictal activity pattern. In the third case, when the dendritic inhibition onto the pyramidal cells was reduced and changes were simultaneously made in synaptic connectivity between all neurons in the network, the basket cells were again observed to enter depolarization block. In the third case, impairment of dendritic inhibition required to generate an ictal activity pattern was lesser than the two previous cases. Moreover, the ictal like activity began earlier in the third case. Hence, our study suggests that greater synaptic plasticity occurring in the whole network due to increase in reception of external excitatory inputs (due to impaired dendritic inhibition) makes the network more susceptible to generation of epileptic activity. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Given their critical roles in shaping brain output, it is important to try to understand the functionality of their computational characteristics. To do this, we focus on specific interneuron subtypes. In particular, it has recently been shown that long-term potentiation is induced specifically on oriens-lacunosum/moleculare (O-LM) interneurons in hippocampus CA1 and that the same cells contain the highest density of dendritic sodium and potassium conductances measured to date. We have created multi-compartment models of an O-LM hippocampal interneuron using passive properties, channel kinetics, densities and distributions specific to this cell type, and explored its signalling characteristics. We found that spike initiation depends on both location and amount of input, as well as the intrinsic properties of the interneuron. Distal synaptic input always produces strong back-propagating spikes whereas proximal input could produce both forward- and back-propagating spikes depending on the input strength. We speculate that the highly active dendrites of these interneurons endow them with a specialized function within the hippocampal circuitry by allowing them to regulate direct and indirect signalling pathways within the hippocampus.},

  abstract = {Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is characterized by recurrent seizures driven by synchronous neuronal activity. The reorganization of the dentate gyrus (DG) in TLE may create pathological conduction pathways for synchronous discharges in the temporal lobe, though critical microcircuit-level detail is missing from this pathophysiological intuition. In particular, the relative contribution of adult-born (abGC) and mature (mGC) granule cells to epileptiform network events remains unknown. We assess dynamics of abGCs and mGCs during interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in mice with TLE as well as sharp-wave ripples (SPW-Rs) in healthy mice, and find that abGCs and mGCs are desynchronized and differentially recruited by IEDs compared to SPW-Rs. We introduce a neural topic model to explain these observations, and find that epileptic DG networks organize into disjoint, cell-type specific pathological ensembles in which abGCs play an outsized role. Our results characterize identified GC subpopulation dynamics in TLE, and reveal a specific contribution of abGCs to IEDs.},

  abstract = {There is great interest in the role of coherent oscillations in the brain. In some cases, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are integral to normal brain function, whereas at other times they are implicated as markers of epileptic tissue. Mechanisms underlying HFO generation, especially in abnormal tissue, are not well understood. Using a physiological computer model of hippocampus, we investigate random synaptic activity (noise) as a potential initiator of HFOs. We explore parameters necessary to produce these oscillations and quantify the response using the tools of stochastic resonance (SR) and coherence resonance (CR). As predicted by SR, when noise was added to the network the model was able to detect a subthreshold periodic signal. Addition of basket cell interneurons produced two novel SR effects: 1) improved signal detection at low noise levels and 2) formation of coherent oscillations at high noise that were entrained to harmonics of the signal frequency. The periodic signal was then removed to study oscillations generated only by noise. The combined effects of network coupling and synaptic noise produced coherent, periodic oscillations within the network, an example of CR. Our results show that, under normal coupling conditions, synaptic noise was able to produce gamma (30–100 Hz) frequency oscillations. Synaptic noise generated HFOs in the ripple range (100–200 Hz) when the network had parameters similar to pathological findings in epilepsy: increased gap junctions or recurrent synaptic connections, loss of inhibitory interneurons such as basket cells, and increased synaptic noise. The model parameters that generated these effects are comparable with published experimental data. We propose that increased synaptic noise and physiological coupling mechanisms are sufficient to generate gamma oscillations and that pathologic changes in noise and coupling similar to those in epilepsy can produce abnormal ripples.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy includes a number of medical conditions with recurrent seizures as common denominator. The large number of different syndromes and seizure types as well as the highly variable inter-individual response to the therapies makes management of this condition often challenging. In the last two decades, a genetic etiology has been revealed in more than half of all epilepsies and single gene defects in ion channels or neurotransmitter receptors have been associated with most inherited forms of epilepsy, including some focal and lesional forms as well as specific epileptic developmental encephalopathies. Several genetic tests are now available, including targeted assays up to revolutionary tools that have made sequencing of all coding (whole exome) and noncoding (whole genome) regions of the human genome possible. These recent technological advances have also driven genetic discovery in epilepsy and increased our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of many epileptic disorders, eventually providing targets for precision medicine in some syndromes, such as Dravet syndrome, pyroxidine-dependent epilepsy, and glucose transporter 1 deficiency. However, these examples represent a relatively small subset of all types of epilepsy, and to date, precision medicine in epilepsy has primarily focused on seizure control, and other clinical aspects, such as neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric comorbidities, have yet been possible to address. We herein summarize the most recent advances in genetic testing and provide up-to-date approaches for the choice of the correct test for some epileptic disorders and tailored treatments that are already applicable in some monogenic epilepsies. In the next years, the most probably scenario is that epilepsy treatment will be very different from the currently almost empirical approach, eventually with a “precision medicine” approach applicable on a large scale.},

  abstract = {Gamma frequency (30–80 Hz) network oscillations have been observed in the hippocampus during several behavioral paradigms in which they are often modulated by a theta frequency (4–12 Hz) oscillation. Interneurons of the hippocampus have been shown to be crucially involved in rhythms generation, and several subtypes with distinct anatomy and physiology have been described. In particular, the oriens lacunosum-moleculare (O-LM) interneurons were shown to synapse on distal apical dendrites of pyramidal cells and to spike preferentially at theta frequency, even in the presence of gamma-field oscillations. O-LM cells have also recently been shown to present higher axonal ramification in the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus. By using a hippocampal network model composed of pyramidal cells and two types of interneurons (O-LM and basket cells), we show here that the O-LM interneurons lead to gamma coherence between anatomically distinct cell modules. We thus propose that this could be a mechanism for coupling longitudinally distant cells excited by entorhinal cortex inputs into gamma-coherent assemblies.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Most focal seizures originate in the temporal lobe and are commonly divided into mesial and lateral temporal epilepsy, depending upon the neuronal circuitry involved. The hallmark features of the mesial temporal epilepsy are aura, unconsciousness, and automatisms. Symptoms often overlap with the lateral temporal epilepsy. However, the latter present a less evident psychomotor arrest, frequent clones and dystonic postures, and common focal to bilateral tonic–clonic seizures. Sclerosis of the hippocampus is the most frequent cause of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). TLE is among all epilepsies the most frequently associated with psychiatric comorbidity. Anxiety, depression, and interictal dysphoria are recurrent psychiatric disorders in pediatric patients with TLE. In addition, these alterations are often combined with cognitive, learning, and behavioral impairment. These comorbidities occur more frequently in TLE with hippocampal sclerosis and with pharmacoresistance. According to the bidirectional hypothesis, the close relationship between TLE and psychiatric features should lead to considering common pathophysiology underlying these disorders. Psychiatric comorbidities considerably reduce the quality of life of these children and their families. Thus, early detection and appropriate management and therapeutic strategies could improve the prognosis of these patients. The aim of this review is to analyze TLE correlation with psychiatric disorders and its underlying conditions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Results: The patients with epilepsy showed significant increase in mean functional connectivity in the alpha band, gamma band and ripple band, significant increase in mean clustering coefficient in the theta band, beta band and ripple band, significant increase in average shortest path length in the theta band and alpha band. Only in the alpha band, a significant negative correlation between mean clustering coefficient and the duration of epilepsy was detected. Conclusions: Our results indicated that the alterations of functional brain network are related to a functional imbalance that resulted from epileptic activity and the brain network of patients with epilepsy become more pathological over time.},

By examining the dynamics as a function of potassium and oxygen, we now account for a wide range of neuronal activities, from spikes to seizures, spreading depression (whether high potassium or hypoxia induced), mixed seizure and spreading depression states, and the terminal anoxic “wave of death.” Such a unified framework demonstrates that all of these dynamics lie along a continuum of the repertoire of the neuron membrane. Our results demonstrate that unified frameworks for neuronal dynamics are feasible, can be achieved using existing biological structures and universal physical conservation principles, and may be of substantial importance in enabling our understanding of brain activity and in the control of pathological states.},

The classical paradigm of action potential physiology states that sodium passes through the membrane only transiently (1-2 milliseconds), before the channels inactivate and cease to conduct sodium ions. However, in reality, a small fraction of the total sodium current (1\%-2\%) remains at steady state despite prolonged depolarization. While this persistent sodium current~(INaP) contributes to normal physiological functioning of neurons, accumulating evidence indicates a particularly pathogenic role for an elevated INaP in epilepsy (reviewed previously1). Due to significant advances over the past decade of epilepsy research concerning the importance of INaP in sodium channelopathies, this review seeks to summarize recent evidence and highlight promising novel anti-seizure medication strategies through preferentially targeting INaP.},

  abstract = {During active exploration, hippocampal neurons exhibit nested rhythmic activity at theta (≈8 Hz) and gamma (≈40 Hz) frequencies. Gamma rhythms may be generated locally by interactions within a class of interneurons mediating fast GABAA (GABAA,fast) inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs), whereas theta rhythms traditionally are thought to be imposed extrinsically. However, the hippocampus contains slow biophysical mechanisms that may contribute to the theta rhythm, either as a resonance activated by extrinsic input or as a purely local phenomenon. For example, region CA1 of the hippocampus contains a slower class of GABAA (GABAA,slow) synapses, believed to be generated by a distinct group of interneurons. Recent evidence indicates that these GABAA,slow interneurons project to the GABAA,fast interneurons that contribute to hippocampal gamma rhythms. Here, we use biophysically based simulations to explore the possible ramifications of interneuronal circuits containing separate classes of GABAA,fast and GABAA,slow interneurons. Simulated interneuronal networks with fast and slow synaptic kinetics can generate mixed theta-gamma rhythmicity under restricted conditions, including strong connections among each population, weaker connections between the two populations, and homogeneity of cellular properties and drive. Under a broader range of conditions, including heterogeneity, the networks can amplify and resynchronize phasic responses to weak phase-dispersed external drive at theta frequencies to either GABAA,slow or GABAA,fast cells. GABAA,slow synapses are necessary for this process of amplification and resynchronization.},

  abstract = {While temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a focal epilepsy, previous work demonstrates that TLE causes widespread brain-network disruptions. Impaired visuospatial attention and learning in TLE may be related to thalamic arousal nuclei connectivity. Our prior preliminary work in a smaller patient cohort suggests that patients with TLE demonstrate abnormal functional connectivity between central lateral (CL) thalamic nucleus and medial occipital lobe. Others have shown pulvinar connectivity disturbances in TLE, but it is incompletely understood how TLE affects pulvinar subnuclei. Also, the effects of epilepsy surgery on thalamic functional connectivity remains poorly understood. In this study, we examine the effects of TLE on functional connectivity of two key thalamic arousal-nuclei: lateral pulvinar (PuL) and CL. We evaluate resting-state functional connectivity of the PuL and CL in 40 patients with TLE and 40 controls using fMRI. In 25 patients, postoperative images ({$>$}1 year) were also compared with preoperative images. Compared to controls, patients with TLE exhibit loss of normal positive connectivity between PuL and lateral occipital lobe (p {$<$} 0.05), and a loss of normal negative connectivity between CL and medial occipital lobe (p {$<$} 0.01, paired t-tests). FMRI amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in TLE trended higher in ipsilateral PuL (p = 0.06), but was lower in the lateral occipital (p {$<$} 0.01) and medial occipital lobe in patients versus controls (p {$<$} 0.05, paired t-tests). More abnormal ALFF in the ipsilateral lateral occipital lobe is associated with worse preoperative performance on Rey Complex Figure Test Immediate (p {$<$} 0.05, r = 0.381) and Delayed scores (p {$<$} 0.05, r = 0.413, Pearson’s Correlations). After surgery, connectivity between PuL and lateral occipital lobe remains abnormal in patients (p {$<$} 0.01), but connectivity between CL and medial occipital lobe improves and is no longer different from control values (p {$>$} 0.05, ANOVA, post hoc Fischer’s LSD). In conclusion, thalamic arousal nuclei exhibit abnormal connectivity with occipital lobe in TLE, and some connections may improve after surgery.

  abstract = {Stroke is the leading cause of neurological diseases globally. Remarkably, epilepsy is a common complication of stroke, which greatly impairs the quality of life of patients and poses a significant clinical challenge. Therefore, a better understanding of the risk factors for poststroke epilepsy is crucial. A recent study published in JAMA Neurology studied the brain network associated with poststroke epilepsy in a group of 76 patients compared to a cohort of 625 control patients using lesion mapping techniques. The results showed that negative functional connectivity between lesion locations and regions in the basal ganglia and cerebellum confers a higher risk of developing epilepsy after stroke. The lesion network nodes associated with epilepsy were identical across different lesion types including hematomas, traumas, tumors, and tubers. Furthermore, the poststroke epilepsy brain network has potential therapeutic relevance to deep brain stimulation (DBS). In a cohort of 30 patients, the functional connectivity between anterior thalamic DBS sites and the lesion network nodes was found to correlate with seizure control after DBS. In summary, the finding provides a novel method for predicting the risk of poststroke epilepsy in patients and may guide brain stimulation treatments for epilepsy.},

  abstract = {Variants in potassium channel-related genes are one of the most important mechanisms underlying abnormal neuronal excitation and disturbances in the cellular resting membrane potential. These variants can cause different forms of epilepsy, which can seriously affect the physical and mental health of patients, especially those with refractory epilepsy or status epilepticus, which are common among pediatric patients and are potentially life-threatening. Variants in potassium ion channel-related genes have been reported in few studies; however, to our knowledge, no systematic review has been published. This study aimed to summarize the epilepsy phenotypes, functional studies, and pharmacological advances associated with different potassium channel gene variants to assist clinical practitioners and drug development teams to develop evidence-based medicine and guide research strategies. PubMed and Google Scholar were searched for relevant literature on potassium channel-related epilepsy reported in the past 5–10 years. Various common potassium ion channel gene variants can lead to heterogeneous epilepsy phenotypes, and functional effects can result from gene deletions and compound effects. Administration of select anti-seizure medications is the primary treatment for this type of epilepsy. Most patients are refractory to anti-seizure medications, and some novel anti-seizure medications have been found to improve seizures. Use of targeted drugs to correct aberrant channel function based on the type of potassium channel gene variant can be used as an evidence-based pathway to achieve precise and individualized treatment for children with epilepsy. Plain Language Summary In this article, the pathogenesis and clinical characteristics of epilepsy caused by different types of potassium channel gene variants are reviewed in the light of the latest research literature at home and abroad, with the expectation of providing a certain theoretical basis for the diagnosis and treatment of children with this type of disease.},
