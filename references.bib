  abstract = {Epilepsy is a chronic disease of the brain characterized by an enduring (i.e., persisting) predisposition to generate seizures, unprovoked by any immediate central nervous system insult, and by the neurobiologic, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of seizure recurrences. Epilepsy affects both sexes and all ages with worldwide distribution. The prevalence and the incidence of epilepsy are slightly higher in men compared to women and tend to peak in the elderly, reflecting the higher frequency of stroke, neurodegenerative diseases, and tumors in this age-group. Focal seizures are more common than generalized seizures both in children and in adults. The etiology of epilepsy varies according to the sociodemographic characteristics of the affected populations and the extent of the diagnostic workup, but a documented cause is still lacking in about 50\% of cases from high-income countries (HIC). The overall prognosis of epilepsy is favorable in the majority of patients when measured by seizure freedom. Reports from low/middle-income countries (LMIC; where patients with epilepsy are largely untreated) give prevalence and remission rates that overlap those of HICs. As the incidence of epilepsy appears higher in most LMICs, the overlapping prevalence can be explained by misdiagnosis, acute symptomatic seizures and premature mortality. Studies have consistently shown that about one-half of cases tend to achieve prolonged seizure remission. However, more recent reports on the long-term prognosis of epilepsy have identified differing prognostic patterns, including early and late remission, a relapsing-remitting course, and even a worsening course (characterized by remission followed by relapse and unremitting seizures). Epilepsy per se carries a low mortality risk, but significant differences in mortality rates are expected when comparing incidence and prevalence studies, children and adults, and persons with idiopathic and symptomatic seizures. Sudden unexplained death is most frequent in people with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, nocturnal seizures, and drug refractory epilepsy.},

Here we report a form of channelopathy that is acquired in experimental temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the most common form of epilepsy in adults. The excitability of CA1 pyramidal neuron dendrites was increased in TLE because of decreased availability of A-type potassium ion channels due to transcriptional (loss of channels) and posttranslational (increased channel phosphorylation by extracellular signal-regulated kinase) mechanisms. Kinase inhibition partly reversed dendritic excitability to control levels. Such acquired channelopathy is likely to amplify neuronal activity and may contribute to the initiation and/or propagation of seizures in TLE.},

  abstract = {The mammalian forebrain is constructed from ensembles of neurons that form local microcircuits giving rise to the exquisite cognitive tasks the mammalian brain can perform. Hippocampal neuronal circuits comprise populations of relatively homogenous excitatory neurons, principal cells and exceedingly heterogeneous inhibitory neurons, the interneurons. Interneurons release GABA from their axon terminals and are capable of controlling excitability in every cellular compartment of principal cells and interneurons alike; thus, they provide a brake on excess activity, control the timing of neuronal discharge and provide modulation of synaptic transmission. The dendritic and axonal morphology of interneurons, as well as their afferent and efferent connections within hippocampal circuits, is central to their ability to differentially control excitability, in a cell-type- and compartment-specific manner. This review aims to provide an up-to-date compendium of described hippocampal interneuron subtypes, with respect to their morphology, connectivity, neurochemistry and physiology, a full understanding of which will in time help to explain the rich diversity of neuronal function.},

  abstract = {The pathologically synchronized neuronal activity in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) can be triggered by network events that were once normal. Under normal conditions, hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) work in synchrony during a variety of cognitive states. Abnormal changes in this circuit may aid to seizure onset and also help to explain the high association of TLE with mood disorders. We used a TLE rat model generated by perforant path (PP) stimulation to understand whether synchrony between dorsal hippocampal and mPFC networks is altered shortly before a seizure episode. We recorded hippocampal and mPFC local field potentials (LFPs) of animals with spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs) to verify the connectivity between these regions. We showed that SRSs decrease hippocampal theta oscillations whereas coherence in theta increases over time prior to seizure onset. This increase in synchrony is accompanied by a stronger coupling between hippocampal theta and mPFC gamma oscillation. Finally, using Granger causality we showed that hippocampus/mPFC synchrony increases in the pre-ictal phase and this increase is likely to be caused by hippocampal networks. The dorsal hippocampus is not directly connected to the mPFC; however, the functional coupling in theta between these two structures rises pre-ictally. Our data indicates that the increase in synchrony between dorsal hippocampus and mPFC may be predictive of seizures and may help to elucidate the network mechanisms that lead to seizure generation.},

Accurate detection of periods of bursting activity is thus an important aspect of characterising both spontaneous and evoked neuronal network activity. A wide variety of computational methods have been developed to detect periods of bursting in spike trains recorded from neuronal networks. In this chapter, we review several of the most popular and successful of these methods.},

We reveal limitations in a number of commonly used burst detection techniques and provide recommendations for the best practice for accurate identification of bursts using existing techniques. An analysis of the ontogeny of bursting activity in a novel data set of recordings from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuronal networks, using the highest-performing burst detectors from our study, is also presented., Accurate identification of bursting activity is an essential element in the characterization of neuronal network activity. Despite this, no one technique for identifying bursts in spike trains has been widely adopted. Instead, many methods have been developed for the analysis of bursting activity, often on an ad hoc basis. Here we provide an unbiased assessment of the effectiveness of eight of these methods at detecting bursts in a range of spike trains. We suggest a list of features that an ideal burst detection technique should possess and use synthetic data to assess each method in regard to these properties. We further employ each of the methods to reanalyze microelectrode array (MEA) recordings from mouse retinal ganglion cells and examine their coherence with bursts detected by a human observer. We show that several common burst detection techniques perform poorly at analyzing spike trains with a variety of properties. We identify four promising burst detection techniques, which are then applied to MEA recordings of networks of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons and used to describe the ontogeny of bursting activity in these networks over several months of development. We conclude that no current method can provide “perfect” burst detection results across a range of spike trains; however, two burst detection techniques, the MaxInterval and logISI methods, outperform compared with others. We provide recommendations for the robust analysis of bursting activity in experimental recordings using current techniques.},

In this first paper, we construct a mathematical model consisting of a single conductance-based neuron together with intra- and extracellular ion concentration dynamics. We formulate a reduction of this model that permits a detailed bifurcation analysis, and show that the reduced model is a reasonable approximation of the full model. We find that competition between intrinsic neuronal currents, sodium-potassium pumps, glia, and diffusion can produce very slow and large-amplitude oscillations in ion concentrations similar to what is seen physiologically in seizures. Using the reduced model, we identify the dynamical mechanisms that give rise to these phenomena. These models reveal several experimentally testable predictions. Our work emphasizes the critical role of ion concentration homeostasis in the proper functioning of neurons, and points to important fundamental processes that may underlie pathological states such as epilepsy.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy is a paroxysmal brain disorder that results from an imbalance between neuronal excitation and inhibition. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the most important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain and plays an important role in the occurrence and development of epilepsy. Abnormalities in all aspects of GABA metabolism, including GABA synthesis, transport, genes encoding GABA receptors, and GABA inactivation, may lead to epilepsy. GABRA1, GABRA2, GABRA5, GABRB1, GABRB2, GABRB3, GABRG2 and GABBR2 are genes that encode GABA receptors and are commonly associated with epilepsy. Mutations of these genes lead to a variety of epilepsy syndromes with different clinical phenotypes, primarily by down regulating receptor expression and reducing the amplitude of GABA-evoked potentials. GABA is metabolized by GABA transaminase and succinate semi aldehyde dehydrogenase, which are encoded by the ABAT and ALDH5A1 genes, respectively. Mutations of these genes result in symptoms related to deficiency of GABA transaminase and succinate semi aldehyde dehydrogenase, such as epilepsy and cognitive impairment. Most of the variation in genes associated with GABA metabolism are accompanied by developmental disorders. This review focuses on advances in understanding the relationship between genetic variation in GABA metabolism and epilepsy to establish a basis for the accurate diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy.},

  abstract = {Under certain conditions, regenerative voltage spikes can be initiated locally in the dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons. These are interesting events that could potentially provide neurons with additional computational abilities. Using whole-cell dendritic recordings from the distal apical trunk and proximal tuft regions and realistic computer modeling, we have determined that highly synchronized and moderately clustered inputs are required for dendritic spike initiation: ∼50 synaptic inputs spread over 100 μm of the apical trunk/tuft need to be activated within 3 msec. Dendritic spikes are characterized by a more depolarized voltage threshold than at the soma [-48 ± 1 mV (n = 30) vs -56 ± 1 mV (n = 7), respectively] and are mainly generated and shaped by dendritic Na+ and K+ currents. The relative contribution of AMPA and NMDA currents is also important in determining the actual spatiotemporal requirements for dendritic spike initiation. Once initiated, dendritic spikes can easily reach the soma, but their propagation is only moderately strong, so that it can be modulated by physiologically relevant factors such as changes in the Vm and the ionic composition of the extracellular solution. With effective spike propagation, an extremely short-latency neuronal output is produced for greatly reduced input levels. Therefore, dendritic spikes function as efficient detectors of specific input patterns, ensuring that the neuronal response to high levels of input synchrony is a precisely timed action potential output.},

  abstract = {The hippocampus is a structure frequently involved in epilepsy, especially in partial drug-resistant forms. In addition, some hippocampal pathologies are associated with specific types of epilepsy presenting specific clinical courses and requiring specific treatments. Considering these major implications for treatment, morphological investigations of the hippocampus are crucial for epileptic patients. Indeed, discovery of hippocampal sclerosis may (depending on the clinical and electrophysiological findings) lead to the diagnosis of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). If the diagnosis of MTLE is retained in a case of drug-resistance, surgery may be proposed without invasive phase II investigations such as stereoelectroencephalograpy. In other instances, hippocampal abnormalities may be associated with epilepsy, but without the same value for localizing the ictal onset zone. Hippocampal dysgenesis is a strong argument for non-temporo-mesial ictal onset ipsilateral to the malformation. We describe here the specific MRI modalities adapted for hippocampal investigations and the radiological signs of hippocampal pathologies associated with epilepsy (especially hippocampal sclerosis and hippocamal dysgenesis). Hippocampus morphological investigations in epilepsy require specific MRI modalities and appropriate knowledge of the specific signs of each pathology. Careful analysis is crucial since the results may have a major impact on the therapeutic management of epileptic patients. Résumé L’hippocampe est une structure fréquemment impliquée dans l’épilepsie, notamment dans les formes partielles pharmacorésistantes. De plus, certaines pathologies hippocampiques sont associées à des formes d’épilepsie dont le traitement et l’évolution sont spécifiques. Compte tenu de l’importance de ces implications en termes thérapeutique, l’imagerie morphologique de l’hippocampe est incontournable chez ces patients. En effet, la mise en évidence d’une sclérose de l’hippocampe conduit (en accord avec les données cliniques et électrophysiologiques) au diagnostic d’épilepsie du lobe temporal mésial (ELTM). Un tel diagnostic permet de proposer une chirurgie de résection de foyer chez les patients pharmacorésistants sans nécessité de bilan de phase II tel une stéréo-électro-encéphalographie. Par ailleurs, d’autres anomalies hippocampiques peuvent être associées à une épilepsie mais sans valeur localisatrice du foyer aussi précise que dans le cas précédent. Une dysgénésie hippocampique est ainsi un argument fort pour un foyer extérieur aux régions temporo-mésiales du côté homolatéral. Nous décrivons dans ce travail les modalités IRM spécifiques à l’exploration morphologique de l’hippocampe ainsi que les signes radiologiques des pathologies de l’hippocampe associées à l’épilepsie (notamment la sclérose et la dysgénésie hippocampique). Les investigations morphologiques de l’hippocampe dans l’épilepsie requièrent des modalités spécifiques de réalisation de l’IRM et une connaissance précise des signes des pathologies associées. Ces explorations sont d’une grande importance en raison de leur impact majeur sur la prise en charge thérapeutique des patients épileptiques.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) are the most common forms of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the loss of cells and progressive irreversible alteration of cognitive functions, such as attention and memory. AD may be an important cause of epilepsy in the elderly. Early diagnosis of diseases is very important for their successful treatment. Many efforts have been done for defining new biomarkers of these diseases. Significant advances have been made in the searching of some AD and TLE reliable biomarkers, including cerebrospinal fluid and plasma measurements and glucose positron emission tomography. However, there is a great need for the biomarkers that would reflect changes of brain activity within few milliseconds to obtain information about cognitive disturbances. Successful early detection of AD and TLE requires specific biomarkers capable of distinguishing individuals with the progressing disease from ones with other pathologies that affect cognition. In this article, we review recent evidence suggesting that magnetoencephalographic recordings and coherent analysis coupled with behavioral evaluation can be a promising approach to an early detection of AD and TLE., Highlights –Data reviewed include the results of clinical and experimental studies.–Theta and gamma rhythms are disturbed in epilepsy and AD.–Common and different behavioral and oscillatory features of pathologies are compared.–Coherent analysis can be useful for an early diagnostics of diseases.},

  abstract = {The dentate gyrus (DG) is part of the hippocampal formation and is essential for important cognitive processes such as navigation and memory. The oscillatory activity of the DG network is believed to play a critical role in cognition. DG circuits generate theta, beta, and gamma rhythms, which participate in the specific information processing performed by DG neurons. In the temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), cognitive abilities are impaired, which may be due to drastic alterations in the DG structure and network activity during epileptogenesis. The theta rhythm and theta coherence are especially vulnerable in dentate circuits; disturbances in DG theta oscillations and their coherence may be responsible for general cognitive impairments observed during epileptogenesis. Some researchers suggested that the vulnerability of DG mossy cells is a key factor in the genesis of TLE, but others did not support this hypothesis. The aim of the review is not only to present the current state of the art in this field of research but to help pave the way for future investigations by highlighting the gaps in our knowledge to completely appreciate the role of DG rhythms in brain functions. Disturbances in oscillatory activity of the DG during TLE development may be a diagnostic marker in the treatment of this disease.},

Computer modeling of normal and reorganized dentate gyrus was used to understand the functional consequences of these structural changes. Hyperexcitability appeared to be largely limited by the powerful intrinsic adaptation characteristic of granule cells, the principal cells in this area. Combining disinhibition with new recurrent excitatory circuitry was necessary to produce repeated firing of these cells. Paradoxically, continuing regenerative activity was only seen with a large reduction in the strength of the inciting stimulus.

Decreased Ih activity, as seen in experimental temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), could significantly alter the response of dendrites to theta inputs. Here we report a progressive erosion of theta resonance and phase lead in pyramidal cell dendrites during epileptogenesis in a rat model of TLE. These alterations were due to decreased Ih availability, via a decline in HCN1/HCN2 subunit expression resulting in decreased h currents, and altered kinetics of the residual channels. This acquired HCN channelopathy thus compromises temporal coding and tuning to theta inputs in pyramidal cell dendrites. Decreased theta resonance in vitro also correlated with a reduction in theta frequency and power in vivo. We suggest that the neuronal/circuitry changes associated with TLE, including altered Ih-dependent inductive mechanisms, can disrupt hippocampal theta function.},

  abstract = {Background This systematic review of epilepsy mortality systematic reviews evaluates comparative risks, causes, and risk factors for all-cause mortality in people with epilepsy (PWE) to specifically establish the burden of epilepsy-related deaths. Methods MEDLINE and Embase were searched from conception to 26/12/2018 for systematic reviews evaluating all-cause mortality in PWE of any age. Independent study selection, data extraction and quality assessment were performed. Deaths were separated into epilepsy-related and unrelated using a recently published classification system. Outcomes included standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and mortality rate (MR) in a primary analysis of comparative risks, causes, and risk factors for all-cause and epilepsy-related mortality. A narrative synthesis of review findings was used to present results, including from a secondary analysis of individual epilepsy-related death risk factors. Results Six moderate or high-quality systematic reviews were included in the primary analysis, evaluating 103 observational studies. All-cause mortality remained similarly high between 1950 and present (median SMR range 2.2–3.4). Africa had the highest SMR (median 5.4, range 2.6–7.2). SMRs were also higher for children {$<$}18 years (median 7.5, range 3.1–22.4) than adults (median 2.6, range 1.3–8.7), and for epilepsy-related (median 3.8, range 0.0–82.4,) than unrelated causes (median 1.7, range 0.7–17.6). Structural brain disease conferred the greatest risk for all-cause mortality (SMR range 24.0–41.5). Common epilepsy-related causes included alcohol, drowning, pneumonia, and suicide. In secondary analysis of nine additional systematic reviews, epilepsy-related death risk factors were reported for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), drowning and suicide. Conclusions Premature all-cause mortality remains a major problem in PWE globally, particularly in children and young adults, with most being epilepsy-related and potentially preventable. SUDEP is only one of several other common and important epilepsy-related causes of death.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy is a devastating brain disorder for which effective treatments are very limited. There is growing interest in early intervention, which requires a better mechanistic understanding of the early stages of this disorder. While diverse brain insults can lead to epileptic activity, a common cellular mechanism relies on uncontrolled recurrent excitatory activity. In the dentate gyrus, excitatory mossy cells (MCs) project extensively onto granule cells (GCs) throughout the hippocampus, thus establishing a recurrent MC-GC-MC excitatory loop. MCs are implicated in temporal lobe epilepsy, a common form of epilepsy, but their role during initial seizures (i.e., before the characteristic MC loss that occurs in late stages) is unclear. Here, we show that initial seizures acutely induced with an intraperitoneal kainic acid (KA) injection in adult mice, a well-established model that leads to experimental epilepsy, not only increased MC and GC activity in~vivo but also triggered a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)–dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) at MC-GC excitatory synapses. Moreover, in~vivo induction of MC-GC LTP using MC-selective optogenetic stimulation worsened KA-induced seizures. Conversely, Bdnf genetic removal from GCs, which abolishes LTP, and selective MC silencing were both anticonvulsant. Thus, initial seizures are associated with MC-GC synaptic strengthening, which may promote later epileptic activity. Our findings reveal a potential mechanism of epileptogenesis that may help in developing therapeutic strategies for early intervention.},

  abstract = {Abnormalities in oscillations have been suggested to play a role in schizophrenia. We studied theta-modulated gamma oscillations in a computer model of hippocampal CA3 in vivo with and without simulated application of ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist and psychotomimetic. Networks of 1200 multicompartment neurons [pyramidal, basket, and oriens-lacunosum moleculare (OLM) cells] generated theta and gamma oscillations from intrinsic network dynamics: basket cells primarily generated gamma and amplified theta, while OLM cells strongly contributed to theta. Extrinsic medial septal inputs paced theta and amplified both theta and gamma oscillations. Exploration of NMDA receptor reduction across all location combinations demonstrated that the experimentally observed ketamine effect occurred only with isolated reduction of NMDA receptors on OLMs. In the ketamine simulations, lower OLM activity reduced theta power and disinhibited pyramidal cells, resulting in increased basket cell activation and gamma power. Our simulations predict the following: (1) ketamine increases firing rates; (2) oscillations can be generated by intrinsic hippocampal circuits; (3) medial-septum inputs pace and augment oscillations; (4) pyramidal cells lead basket cells at the gamma peak but lag at trough; (5) basket cells amplify theta rhythms; (6) ketamine alters oscillations due to primary blockade at OLM NMDA receptors; (7) ketamine alters phase relationships of cell firing; (8) ketamine reduces network responsivity to the environment; (9) ketamine effect could be reversed by providing a continuous inward current to OLM cells. We suggest that this last prediction has implications for a possible novel treatment for cognitive deficits of schizophrenia by targeting OLM cells.},

The visualization and analysis of hubs offers a perspective on regional and global network organization and can provide novel insights into brain disorders and epilepsy. By notably supporting the interaction between various brain networks, hubs may be implicated in seizure spread and in epilepsy-related phenotypes. In this review, we will discuss the growing literature on atypical hub organization in common epilepsy syndromes, both related to neuroimaging of brain structure and function, and related to neurophysiological data from magneto- and electroencephalographic measures of neural dynamics. With studies increasingly exploring the clinical utility of network neuroscience approaches, we highlight the potential of hub mapping as a candidate biomarker of cognitive dysfunction and postsurgical seizure outcome.

  abstract = {Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a common type of epilepsy with hippocampus as the usual site of origin. The CA3 subfield of hippocampus is reported to have a low epileptic threshold and hence initiates the disorder in patients with TLE. This study computationally investigates how impaired dendritic inhibition of pyramidal cells in the vulnerable CA3 subfield leads to generation of epileptic activity. A model of CA3 subfield consisting of 800 pyramidal cells, 200 basket cells (BC) and 200 Oriens—Lacunosum Moleculare (O-LM) interneurons was used. The dendritic inhibition provided by O-LM interneurons is reported to be selectively impaired in some TLEs. A step-wise approach is taken to investigate how alterations in network connectivity lead to generation of epileptic patterns. Initially, dendritic inhibition alone was reduced, followed by an increase in the external inputs received at the distal dendrites of pyramidal cells, and finally additional changes were made at the synapses between all neurons in the network. In the first case, when the dendritic inhibition of pyramidal cells alone was reduced, the local field potential activity changed from a theta-modulated gamma pattern to a prominently gamma frequency pattern. In the second case, in addition to this reduction of dendritic inhibition, with a simultaneous large increase in the external excitatory inputs received by pyramidal cells, the basket cells entered a state of depolarization block, causing the network to generate a typical ictal activity pattern. In the third case, when the dendritic inhibition onto the pyramidal cells was reduced and changes were simultaneously made in synaptic connectivity between all neurons in the network, the basket cells were again observed to enter depolarization block. In the third case, impairment of dendritic inhibition required to generate an ictal activity pattern was lesser than the two previous cases. Moreover, the ictal like activity began earlier in the third case. Hence, our study suggests that greater synaptic plasticity occurring in the whole network due to increase in reception of external excitatory inputs (due to impaired dendritic inhibition) makes the network more susceptible to generation of epileptic activity. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Given their critical roles in shaping brain output, it is important to try to understand the functionality of their computational characteristics. To do this, we focus on specific interneuron subtypes. In particular, it has recently been shown that long-term potentiation is induced specifically on oriens-lacunosum/moleculare (O-LM) interneurons in hippocampus CA1 and that the same cells contain the highest density of dendritic sodium and potassium conductances measured to date. We have created multi-compartment models of an O-LM hippocampal interneuron using passive properties, channel kinetics, densities and distributions specific to this cell type, and explored its signalling characteristics. We found that spike initiation depends on both location and amount of input, as well as the intrinsic properties of the interneuron. Distal synaptic input always produces strong back-propagating spikes whereas proximal input could produce both forward- and back-propagating spikes depending on the input strength. We speculate that the highly active dendrites of these interneurons endow them with a specialized function within the hippocampal circuitry by allowing them to regulate direct and indirect signalling pathways within the hippocampus.},

  abstract = {Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is characterized by recurrent seizures driven by synchronous neuronal activity. The reorganization of the dentate gyrus (DG) in TLE may create pathological conduction pathways for synchronous discharges in the temporal lobe, though critical microcircuit-level detail is missing from this pathophysiological intuition. In particular, the relative contribution of adult-born (abGC) and mature (mGC) granule cells to epileptiform network events remains unknown. We assess dynamics of abGCs and mGCs during interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in mice with TLE as well as sharp-wave ripples (SPW-Rs) in healthy mice, and find that abGCs and mGCs are desynchronized and differentially recruited by IEDs compared to SPW-Rs. We introduce a neural topic model to explain these observations, and find that epileptic DG networks organize into disjoint, cell-type specific pathological ensembles in which abGCs play an outsized role. Our results characterize identified GC subpopulation dynamics in TLE, and reveal a specific contribution of abGCs to IEDs.},

  abstract = {There is great interest in the role of coherent oscillations in the brain. In some cases, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are integral to normal brain function, whereas at other times they are implicated as markers of epileptic tissue. Mechanisms underlying HFO generation, especially in abnormal tissue, are not well understood. Using a physiological computer model of hippocampus, we investigate random synaptic activity (noise) as a potential initiator of HFOs. We explore parameters necessary to produce these oscillations and quantify the response using the tools of stochastic resonance (SR) and coherence resonance (CR). As predicted by SR, when noise was added to the network the model was able to detect a subthreshold periodic signal. Addition of basket cell interneurons produced two novel SR effects: 1) improved signal detection at low noise levels and 2) formation of coherent oscillations at high noise that were entrained to harmonics of the signal frequency. The periodic signal was then removed to study oscillations generated only by noise. The combined effects of network coupling and synaptic noise produced coherent, periodic oscillations within the network, an example of CR. Our results show that, under normal coupling conditions, synaptic noise was able to produce gamma (30–100 Hz) frequency oscillations. Synaptic noise generated HFOs in the ripple range (100–200 Hz) when the network had parameters similar to pathological findings in epilepsy: increased gap junctions or recurrent synaptic connections, loss of inhibitory interneurons such as basket cells, and increased synaptic noise. The model parameters that generated these effects are comparable with published experimental data. We propose that increased synaptic noise and physiological coupling mechanisms are sufficient to generate gamma oscillations and that pathologic changes in noise and coupling similar to those in epilepsy can produce abnormal ripples.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Epilepsy genetics is shifting from the academic pursuit of gene discovery to a clinical discipline based on molecular diagnosis and stratified medicine. We consider the latest developments in epilepsy genetics and review how gene discovery in epilepsy is influencing the clinical classification of epilepsy and informing new therapeutic approaches and drug discovery. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies highlighting the importance of mutation in GABA receptors, NMDA receptors, potassium channels, G-protein coupled receptors, mammalian target of rapamycin pathway and chromatin remodeling are discussed. Examples of precision medicine in epilepsy targeting gain-of-function mutations in KCNT1, GRIN2A, GRIN2D and SCN8A are presented. Potential reasons for the paucity of examples of precision medicine for loss-of-function mutations or in non-ion channel epilepsy genes are explored. We highlight how systems genetics and gene network analyses have suggested that pathways disrupted in epilepsy overlap with those of other neurodevelopmental traits including human cognition. We review how network-based computational approaches are now being applied to epilepsy drug discovery. SUMMARY: We are living in an unparalleled era of epilepsy gene discovery. Advances in clinical care from this progress are already materializing through improved clinical diagnosis and stratified medicine. The application of targeted drug repurposing based on single gene defects has shown promise for epilepsy arising from gain-of-function mutations in ion-channel subunit genes, but important barriers remain to translating these approaches to non-ion channel epilepsy genes and loss-of-function mutations. Gene network analysis offers opportunities to discover new pathways for epilepsy, to decipher epilepsy's relationship to other neurodevelopmental traits and to frame a new approach to epilepsy drug discovery.},

  abstract = {Gamma frequency (30–80 Hz) network oscillations have been observed in the hippocampus during several behavioral paradigms in which they are often modulated by a theta frequency (4–12 Hz) oscillation. Interneurons of the hippocampus have been shown to be crucially involved in rhythms generation, and several subtypes with distinct anatomy and physiology have been described. In particular, the oriens lacunosum-moleculare (O-LM) interneurons were shown to synapse on distal apical dendrites of pyramidal cells and to spike preferentially at theta frequency, even in the presence of gamma-field oscillations. O-LM cells have also recently been shown to present higher axonal ramification in the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus. By using a hippocampal network model composed of pyramidal cells and two types of interneurons (O-LM and basket cells), we show here that the O-LM interneurons lead to gamma coherence between anatomically distinct cell modules. We thus propose that this could be a mechanism for coupling longitudinally distant cells excited by entorhinal cortex inputs into gamma-coherent assemblies.},

  abstract = {The pathological phenomena of seizures and spreading depression have long been considered separate physiological events in the brain. By incorporating conservation of particles and charge, and accounting for the energy required to restore ionic gradients, we extend the classic Hodgkin–Huxley formalism to uncover a unification of neuronal membrane dynamics. By examining the dynamics as a function of potassium and oxygen, we now account for a wide range of neuronal activities, from spikes to seizures, spreading depression (whether high potassium or hypoxia induced), mixed seizure and spreading depression states, and the terminal anoxic “wave of death.” Such a unified framework demonstrates that all of these dynamics lie along a continuum of the repertoire of the neuron membrane. Our results demonstrate that unified frameworks for neuronal dynamics are feasible, can be achieved using existing biological structures and universal physical conservation principles, and may be of substantial importance in enabling our understanding of brain activity and in the control of pathological states.},

  abstract = {During active exploration, hippocampal neurons exhibit nested rhythmic activity at theta (≈8 Hz) and gamma (≈40 Hz) frequencies. Gamma rhythms may be generated locally by interactions within a class of interneurons mediating fast GABAA (GABAA,fast) inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs), whereas theta rhythms traditionally are thought to be imposed extrinsically. However, the hippocampus contains slow biophysical mechanisms that may contribute to the theta rhythm, either as a resonance activated by extrinsic input or as a purely local phenomenon. For example, region CA1 of the hippocampus contains a slower class of GABAA (GABAA,slow) synapses, believed to be generated by a distinct group of interneurons. Recent evidence indicates that these GABAA,slow interneurons project to the GABAA,fast interneurons that contribute to hippocampal gamma rhythms. Here, we use biophysically based simulations to explore the possible ramifications of interneuronal circuits containing separate classes of GABAA,fast and GABAA,slow interneurons. Simulated interneuronal networks with fast and slow synaptic kinetics can generate mixed theta-gamma rhythmicity under restricted conditions, including strong connections among each population, weaker connections between the two populations, and homogeneity of cellular properties and drive. Under a broader range of conditions, including heterogeneity, the networks can amplify and resynchronize phasic responses to weak phase-dispersed external drive at theta frequencies to either GABAA,slow or GABAA,fast cells. GABAA,slow synapses are necessary for this process of amplification and resynchronization.},
