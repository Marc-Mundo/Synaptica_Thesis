\section{Results of the Baseline activity}
In the initial experiment, the baseline activity of the CA3 network was
observed from the \textit{original model} by
\textcite{sanjayImpairedDendriticInhibition2015}. The network was simulated for
5000 ms and showed somewhat synchronous activity throughout all three
populations (pyr, BC and OLM). Basket cells showed a higher firing rate
compared to the pyramidal cells and OLM cells. The basket cells seem to swap
between states of synchrony and asynchrony which is not observed in the other
two populations. The OLM cells showed a lower firing rate compared to the
pyramidal cells and basket cells. The baseline activity of the CA3 network is
shown in figure~\ref{fig:baseline_activity}.

        The above figure shows the baseline activity of the CA3 network. The network was simulated for 5000 ms. The spike activity in time of the Pyr cells, BC cells, and OLM cells are shown based on the Neuron ID\@. ID 0--799 = Pyramidal (blue), 800--999 = BC (green), 1000--1200 = OLM (red). The x-axis represents the time in ms and the y-axis represents the neuron ID\@.

\section{Results of the Model validation}
To test whether our implementation of the CA3 network was able to replicate
more elaborate results, results from figure 6 of the original
\textcite{sanjayImpairedDendriticInhibition2015} article were replicated in
figure~\ref{fig:validation_firing_rates},~\ref{fig:validation_frequencies} and
~\ref{fig:validation_power}. The results show that the model was able to
replicate the results of the original article with slightly lower firing rates,
theta-gamma frequencies and power, which can be seen in
table~\ref{tab:baseline_results}.

        The above figure shows the firing rates of the Pyr cells, BC cells, and OLM cells. The firing rates were calculated from the spike activity of the cells. The x-axis represents the cell type and the y-axis represents the firing rate in Hz. The error bars represent the standard deviation of the firing rates.
