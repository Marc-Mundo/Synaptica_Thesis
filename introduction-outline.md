## 1. Overview of Epilepsy and Neural Dynamics

- Brief description of epilepsy, emphasizing its impact on individuals' lives and the importance of understanding neural dynamics in epileptic conditions.

- Highlight the significance of computational models in unraveling the complex mechanisms underlying epileptic seizures.

## 2. Importance of Hippocampal CA3 Region in Epilepsy

Introduce the hippocampus, focusing on the CA3 subfield, known for its susceptibility to epileptiform activity due to its unique structural and functional properties.
Discuss previous findings on the role of the CA3 region in initiating and propagating epileptic activity.

Hippocampal CA3 Region's Role in Epilepsy:

- Theta Gamma Oscillations: Discuss the significance of theta-gamma coupling in the CA3 region and its relevance to understanding normal and epileptic brain states. Mention how these oscillations can serve as markers for neural network states and their modulation during epileptic events.
- (Inter-)ictal Activity: Briefly explain the concepts of inter-ictal (between seizures) and ictal (seizure) activity within the CA3 region, emphasizing the importance of differentiating these states for understanding and treating epilepsy.
- Modeling with NEURON and Hodgkin-Huxley: Introduce the Neuron simulation environment and the Hodgkin-Huxley model as foundational tools for simulating the electrical characteristics of neurons, including those in the CA3 region. Highlight their role in building accurate computational models of epileptic activity.
- Sodium-Potassium Channelopathies and AEDs: Touch on the relevance of sodium and potassium channelopathies in the etiology of epilepsy and the mechanism of action of Anti-epileptic Drugs (AEDs) targeting these channels. Discuss how understanding these channelopathies can inform the development of more effective treatments and the importance of computational models in exploring these aspects.

## 3. Computational Modeling in Neuroscience

- Briefly overview the role of computational models in neuroscience, highlighting their contribution to understanding brain functions and dysfunctions.
- Mention the advantages of using computational models to simulate neural dynamics, including the ability to manipulate variables and parameters that are not easily accessible in vivo or in vitro experiments.

## 4. Gap in the Literature

- Identify gaps in current understanding or limitations of existing models, particularly in simulating the CA3 hippocampal network's behavior during epileptic seizures.
- Justify the need for a more comprehensive or nuanced model that can accurately capture the dynamics of epilepsy within the CA3 region.

## 5. Objective of the Current Research

- State the primary aim of the research, which could involve developing a refined computational model of the CA3 hippocampal network that incorporates specific cellular and synaptic parameters, external stimuli, and noise conditions to explore epileptic neural dynamics.
- Highlight how this research builds upon previous work, offering novel insights or addressing previously identified gaps.

## 6. Scope and Structure of the Thesis

- Outline the structure of the thesis, briefly describing the content of subsequent chapters, including methods, results, discussion, and conclusions.
- Emphasize the interdisciplinary approach, combining computational neuroscience, cellular neurobiology, and systems biology to achieve the research objectives.
